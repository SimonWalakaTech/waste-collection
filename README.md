this project is aimed reducing improper waste disposal by rewarding proper waste disposal  with carbon credits
It has an application that helps the volunteer track their credits
volunteers create accounts which are linked with their rfid tags
volunteers get rfid based cards that are directly linked with their accounts
in an event of disposal when the user contact with a bin , they are rewarded basing on the weight of the waste
Bins are fitted with rfid readers that automatically detects the user using their rfid tags
this encourages proper waste disposal
